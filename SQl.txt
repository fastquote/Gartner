# SQL Test Assignment

Attached is a mysqldump of a database to be used during the test.

Below are the questions for this test. Please enter a full, complete, working SQL statement under each question. We do not want the answer to the question. We want the SQL command to derive the answer. We will copy/paste these commands to test the validity of the answer.

_Q. Select all users_

- Please return at least first_name and last_name

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users;

inner join listings l on u.id=l.user_id 
join clicks c on l.id=c.listing_id 
where u.status=2 and Year(c.created)=2013 group by u.id,c.listing_id,u.first_name,c.price;



5. Insert a new click for listing id 3, at $4.00
- Find out the id of this new click. Please return at least: id
Insert Into `clicks`(`listing_id`,`price`)  Values (3,4.00);
select `id` from `clicks` where `id`=(SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID());
